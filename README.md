Overview
This project prepares the Customer Personality Analysis dataset for further analysis and modeling by performing systematic data cleaning and preprocessing steps.

Steps Performed

1. Data Import

Loaded marketing_campaign.csv using Pandas.

Shuffled the data for randomness.

2. Initial Exploration

Checked dataset shape, column names, and data types.

Reviewed the first few rows to understand the data.

3. Identified missing values and data inconsistencies.

Handling Missing Values

Filled missing values in the Income column with the median to preserve distribution and avoid bias.

4. Removing Duplicates

Detected and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

5. Final Dataset

Produced a cleaned dataset ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) or machine learning tasks.

Tools Used
Python

Pandas — Data manipulation

NumPy — Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn — Data visualization

Outcome:

A clean and consistent dataset, free from missing values in key fields and duplicates, ready for analysis.
